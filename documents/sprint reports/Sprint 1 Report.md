## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
<!-- Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team. -->

We started fairly slow and are still going quite slow, but we have managed to lay an excellent foundation for what the project's codebase should look and feel like. Additionally, we were able to implement the basic and critical user features, notably user authentication, and basic inputting and outputting of data that users would store.

## Unfinished Work
<!-- If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later. -->

Due to the early nature of this sprint, as well as some group members being unable to complete their assigned tasks, a large amount of the project remains to be done; notably, there is no functionality surrounding roommate requests, room usage reports, booking notifications, room searching, and maintenance requests.
